# Perflab-cs33
Lab 4 for Tony Nowatzski's CS33 in Fall 2022. Received energy-delay improvement of 581.84. Highest in class. Goal was to use cache-based techniques we'd learned in order to improve the performance and energy usage of the three different linear algebra kernel operations and one matrix transpose.
